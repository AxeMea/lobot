Description:
    Lobot is a gem that will help you spin-up, bootstrap, and install Jenkins for CI for your Rails app on Amazon EC2.

Example:
    rails generate lobot:install

    This will create:
        chef/ - chef cookbooks in a subfolder
        config/ci.yml - a configuration file for lobot
        script/ci_build.sh - a build script you can use to run your CI build
        config/capistrano/ci.rb - a set of lobot specific Capistrano tasks

    rails generate lobot:config

    This will configure config/ci.yml for you
